          "We are the music makers, And we are the dreamers of dreams, Wandering
          by lone sea-breakers, And sitting by desolate streams; â€” World-losers
          and world-forsakers, On whom the pale moon gleams: Yet we are the
          movers and shakers Of the world for ever, it seems."
